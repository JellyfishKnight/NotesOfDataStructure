~~--For some reasons, here won't record any code for those data structures which have been realized in STL--~~

**Because of some unknown reasons, I have to complete those basic data structures in the STL**

~~**As the difficulties I have met in realize the _PFC encode_ by binary tree, I will put this aside.**~~

**PFC encode Tree will not be considered to realize anymore**


<hr>

**The difference between binary search tree and B- tree is most reflected on the way that the computer visit the storage.**

**The first one will spend a lot more time on visit the outer storage, while the latter one is on the contrary.**

**_Notice!!!_**

:joy: _**Great Update**_ :joy: 

>**Those data structures has been written to be compiled as static libraries which are provided to the
main.cpp to use.**
