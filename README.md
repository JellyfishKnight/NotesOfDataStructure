# As a note for my learning progress

<hr>

~~--For some reasons, here won't record any code for those data structures which have been realized in STL--~~

~~> such as vector, queue, dequeue, stack and so on~~

<hr>

**Because of some unknown reasons, I have to complete those basic data structures in the STL**

> **such as Vector, Queue, and Stack**
> 
> **However, there are still some althorigms that I haven't yet finished**

> **such as QuickSort, HeapSort etc.**

~~**As the difficulties I have met in realize the _PFC encode_ by binary tree, I will put this aside.**~~

**PFC encode Tree will not be considered to realize anymore**


<hr>

**The difference between binary search tree and B- tree is most reflected on the way that the computer visit the storage.**

**The first one will spend a lot more time on visit the outer storage, while the latter one is on the contrary.**

<hr>

**_Notice!!!_**

:joy: _**Great Update**_ :joy: 

>**Those data structures has been written to be compiled as static libraries which are provided to the
main.cpp to use.** 
> 
> **And because I can't really understand the theory of Red-Black tree, I give up the thought to develop the dirctionary, and start to learn the althorigm of string.**

_**写在最后:**_
>不得不说数据结构很枯燥,但是用心去对待它你还是会学到很多有趣的思想,鉴于一些本人的能力原因,部分的数据结构并没有去完成,算是一点小遗憾,总之呢,数据结构的学习就告一段落了
> 这段时间学了很多,还是很开心的,在最后的部分我完善了快速排序和串的一些算法.所有的代码参考来源是清华大学的数据结构教材,c++版.虽然我学的很烂,但是希望你看到这个仓库的时候他能帮到你什么.
> 就这样吧,应该开启新的学习了.
